## Reflection for Task E

This collaboration involved two GitHub accounts, Account A and Account B.

### Workflow:
- Forked the repository from Account A to Account B.
- Cloned the fork locally using Account B.
- Created a new branch 'feature-update'.
- Made changes and pushed them.
- Created a pull request from Account B to Account A.

### Challenges:
Faced issues with push due to branch conflicts and missing collaborator permissions. Resolved by adjusting Git settings and using force push when needed.

### Verification:
- Repo: https://github.com/Aditya74773/git_byod3
- Pull Request and Feature Branch updated with changes.
